  "text": " nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. \"nature\" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. the study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.&#91;1&#93; within the various uses of the word today, \"nature\" often refers to geology and wildlife. nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the earth. it is often taken to mean the \"natural environment\" or wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. for example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, \"human nature\" or \"the whole of nature\". this more traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind. depending on the particular context, the term \"natural\" might also be distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural.&#91;1&#93;earth is the only planet known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. within the solar system, it is third closest to the sun; it is the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall. its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region.&#91;7&#93;precipitation varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. the remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the northern hemisphere.\n.the atmospheric conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life-forms,&#91;8&#93; which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions. despite the wide regional variations in climate by latitude and other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods,&#91;9&#93; and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on the ecological balance, and on the actual geography of the earth.&#91;10&#93;&#91;11&#93;during the neoproterozoic era, freezing temperatures covered much of the earth in glaciers and ice sheets. this hypothesis has been termed the \"snowball earth\", and it is of particular interest as it precedes the cambrian explosion in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about 530–540&#160;million years ago.&#91;17&#93;since the cambrian explosion there have been five distinctly identifiable mass extinctions.&#91;18&#93; the last mass extinction occurred some 66 million years ago, when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the non-aviandinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared small animals such as mammals. over the past 66&#160;million years, mammalian life diversified.&#91;19&#93;several million years ago, a species of small african ape gained the ability to stand upright.&#91;15&#93; the subsequent advent of human life, and the development of agriculture and further civilization allowed humans to affect the earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate. by comparison, the great oxygenation event, produced by the proliferation of algae during the siderian period, required about 300&#160;million years to culminate.\n.the earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the ecosystem. the thin layer of gases that envelops the earth is held in place by gravity. air is mostly nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc. the atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude. the ozone layer plays an important role in depleting the amount of ultraviolet (uv) radiation that reaches the surface. as dna is readily damaged by uv light, this serves to protect life at the surface. the atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.\n.water is a chemical substance that is composed of hydrogen and oxygen (h2o) and is vital for all known forms of life.&#91;29&#93; in typical usage, water refers only to its liquid form or state, but the substance also has a solid state, ice, and a gaseous state, water vapor, or steam. water covers 71% of the earth's surface.&#91;30&#93; on earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large bodies of water, with 1.6% of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% in the air as vapor, clouds, and precipitation.&#91;31&#93;&#91;32&#93; oceans hold 97% of surface water, glaciers, and polar ice caps 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. additionally, a minute amount of the earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.\n.a stream is a flowing body of water with a current, confined within a bed and stream banks. in the united states, a stream is classified as a watercourse less than 60 feet (18 metres) wide. streams are important as conduits in the water cycle, instruments in groundwater recharge, and they serve as corridors for fish and wildlife migration. the biological habitat in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a riparian zone. given the status of the ongoing holocene extinction, streams play an important corridor role in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving biodiversity. the study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science and engineering, including hydrology, fluvial geomorphology, aquatic ecology, fish biology, riparian ecology, and others.\n.a smaller unit of size is called a microecosystem. for example, a microsystem can be a stone and all the life under it. a macroecosystem might involve a whole ecoregion, with its drainage basin.&#91;45&#93.although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by organization, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli, and reproduction.&#91;47&#93; life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of organisms.\n.properties common to terrestrial organisms (plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria) are that they are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. an entity with these properties is generally considered life. however, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential. human-made analogs of life may also be considered to be life.\n.the biosphere is the part of earth's outer shell—including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere—within which life occurs, and which biotic processes in turn alter or transform. from the broadest geophysiological point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere (rocks), hydrosphere (water), and atmosphere (air). the entire earth contains over 75&#160;billion tons (150 trillion pounds or about 6.8×1013&#160;kilograms) of biomass (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.&#91;48&#93;over nine-tenths of the total biomass on earth is plant life, on which animal life depends very heavily for its existence.&#91;49&#93; more than 2 million species of plant and animal life have been identified to date,&#91;50&#93; and estimates of the actual number of existing species range from several million to well over 50&#160;million.&#91;51&#93;&#91;52&#93;&#91;53&#93; the number of individual species of life is constantly in some degree of flux, with new species appearing and others ceasing to exist on a continual basis.&#91;54&#93;&#91;55&#93; the total number of species is in rapid decline.&#91;56&#93;&#91;57&#93;&#91;58&#93;the origin of life on earth is not well understood, but it is known to have occurred at least 3.5&#160;billion years ago,&#91;61&#93;&#91;62&#93;&#91;63&#93; during the hadean or archean eons on a primordial earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present.&#91;64&#93; these life forms possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits. once life had appeared, the process of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.\n.species that were unable to adapt to the changing environment and competition from other life forms became extinct. however, the fossil record retains evidence of many of these older species. current fossil and dna evidence shows that all existing species can trace a continual ancestry back to the first primitive life forms.&#91;64&#93.when basic forms of plant life developed the process of photosynthesis the sun's energy could be harvested to create conditions which allowed for more complex life forms.&#91;65&#93; the resultant oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere and gave rise to the ozone layer. the incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of yet more complex cells called eukaryotes.&#91;66&#93; cells within colonies became increasingly specialized, resulting in true multicellular organisms. with the ozone layer absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, life colonized the surface of earth.\n.the first form of life to develop on the earth were microbes, and they remained the only form of life until about a billion years ago when multi-cellular organisms began to appear.&#91;67&#93; microorganisms are single-celled organisms that are generally microscopic, and smaller than the human eye can see. they include bacteria, fungi, archaea, and protista.\n.these life forms are found in almost every location on the earth where there is liquid water, including in the earth's interior.&#91;68&#93;\ntheir reproduction is both rapid and profuse. the combination of a high mutation rate and a horizontal gene transfer&#91;69&#93; ability makes them highly adaptable, and able to survive in new environments, including outer space.&#91;70&#93; they form an essential part of the planetary ecosystem. however, some microorganisms are pathogenic and can post health risk to other organisms.\n.originally aristotle divided all living things between plants, which generally do not move fast enough for humans to notice, and animals. in linnaeus' system, these became the kingdomsvegetabilia (later plantae) and animalia. since then, it has become clear that the plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the fungi and several groups of algae were removed to new kingdoms. however, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. bacterial life is sometimes included in flora,&#91;71&#93;&#91;72&#93; and some classifications use the term bacterial flora separately from plant flora.\n.among the many ways of classifying plants are by regional floras, which, depending on the purpose of study, can also include fossil flora, remnants of plant life from a previous era. people in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora, which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and terrain.\n.another category of plant has historically been carved out for weeds. though the term has fallen into disfavor among botanists as a formal way to categorize \"useless\" plants, the informal use of the word \"weeds\" to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of nature. similarly, animals are often categorized in ways such as domestic, farm animals, wild animals, pests, etc. according to their relationship to human life.\n.the development of technology by the human race has allowed the greater exploitation of natural resources and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards. in spite of this progress, however, the fate of human civilization remains closely linked to changes in the environment. there exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood.&#91;76&#93; man-made threats to the earth's natural environment include pollution, deforestation, and disasters such as oil spills. humans have contributed to the extinction of many plants and animals,&#91;77&#93; with roughly 1 million species threatened with extinction within decades.&#91;78&#93; the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem functions over the last half century have impacted the extent that nature can contribute to human quality of life,&#91;79&#93; and continued declines could pose a major threat to the continued existence of human civilization, unless a rapid course correction is made.&#91;80&#93; the value of natural resources to human society is not reflected in market prices because mostly natural resources are available free of charge. this distorts market pricing of natural resources and at the same time leads to underinvestment in our natural assets. the annual global cost of public subsidies that damage nature is conservatively estimated at $4–$6 trillion (million million). institutional protections of these natural goods, such as the oceans and rainforests, are lacking. governments have not prevented these economic externalities.&#91;81&#93;&#91;82&#93;outer space is sparsely filled with several dozen types of organicmolecules discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy, blackbody radiation left over from the big bang and the origin of the universe, and cosmic rays, which include ionizedatomic nuclei and various subatomic particles. there is also some gas, plasma and dust, and small meteors. additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous crewed and uncrewed launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft. some of this debris re-enters the atmosphere periodically.\n.although earth is the only body within the solar system known to support life, evidence suggests that in the distant past the planet mars possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface.&#91;93&#93; for a brief period in mars' history, it may have also been capable of forming life. at present though, most of the water remaining on mars is frozen.\nif life exists at all on mars, it is most likely to be located underground where liquid water can still exist.&#91;94&#93;conditions on the other terrestrial planets, mercury and venus, appear to be too harsh to support life as we know it. but it has been conjectured that europa, the fourth-largest moon of jupiter, may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.&#91;95&#93;astronomers have started to discover extrasolar earth analogs – planets that lie in the habitable zone of space surrounding a star, and therefore could possibly host life as we know it.&#91;96&#93;"
